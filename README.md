Add a file at the root of the project: `.env`
you can copy/paste `.env.example`

you can use this application with docker also:
`docker compose up -d`

warning: this project contains a package `bcrypt` that is used to encrypt passwords
before saving in the database, due to differences about the package in windows and linux (used in docker and the container) it throws some errors
Personal recommendation: if you are using windows, i sugest you to run directly in your
computer

either with docker or in local machine, typeorm global package will be necessary (npx or global installation)
`yarn global add typeorm`

with typeorm available and a database up and running, run the migrations by:
`yarn typeorm migration:run -d ./db/postgresql`

wait for completition and you finally can
